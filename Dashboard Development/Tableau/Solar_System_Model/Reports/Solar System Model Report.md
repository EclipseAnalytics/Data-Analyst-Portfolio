## Executive Summary
This report details the analytical process and findings from the Solar System Model project, which aimed to visualize various aspects of our solar system using data-driven insights. Key findings include the spatial relationships and physical characteristics of celestial bodies, offering a comprehensive view of size comparisons, orbital paths, and environmental conditions such as surface temperatures and atmospheric compositions.

## Introduction

### Background
The motivation for this study was to leverage astronomical data to create a series of interactive visualizations that depict the solar system's dynamics and characteristics in an educational format. This project was designed to aid in astronomical education and provide a clear visualization tool for understanding complex celestial mechanics and physical properties.

### Objectives
The main objectives of this project were to:
- Visualize the orbits of planets over time from 1800 to 2200.
- Compare the physical sizes and other characteristics of planets and their moons.
- Analyze and display the solar radiation levels and surface temperatures of celestial bodies.

## Data Collection
Data for this project was sourced from NASA's National Space Science Data Center and processed using the Astropy library to generate positional data for planets and the Sun. Additional data concerning the physical characteristics of planets and moons were collated from various authoritative sources and transformed for analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning involved standardizing data formats, correcting misalignments, and converting units where necessary. Challenges such as handling large datasets and ensuring accurate time series data were addressed through rigorous data validation and cleaning processes.

## Analysis
### Methodology
The analysis employed quantitative methods including time series analysis, comparative analysis, and categorical comparison using Tableau Desktop as the primary tool for creating interactive visualizations.

### Results
#### Visualization 1: Solar System Overview (1800-2200)
This 2D map provides a dynamic representation of planetary positions over four centuries, offering insights into orbital patterns and changes over time.

#### Visualization 2: Planetary Orbits
Using trajectory analysis, this visualization highlights the elliptical orbits of planets, illustrating their relative distances from the Sun and each other.

#### Visualization 3: Comparative Planet Sizes
A bar chart that effectively compares the diameters of planets, emphasizing the diversity in size within our solar system.

#### Visualization 4: Moons of the Solar System
A tree map that displays the number and relative sizes of moons orbiting the planets, highlighting the significant number of moons that orbit Jupiter and Saturn.

#### Visualization 5: Planetary Surface Temperatures
A line chart that outlines the average surface temperatures of planets, providing insights into environmental conditions.

#### Visualization 6: Planetary Mass Distribution
A pie chart that shows the mass distribution among the planets, illustrating the mass dominance of Jupiter.

#### Visualization 7: Moons Sizes Comparison
A packed bubbles' chart that compares the sizes of moons, revealing the varied dimensions of moons and their distribution across the solar system.

## Discussion
The results affirm the dynamic and varied nature of our solar system, with each visualization offering unique insights into celestial phenomena. The visualizations collectively enhance our understanding of the solar system's composition and dynamics.

## Recommendations
Further studies should consider incorporating additional variables such as asteroid impacts, cometary paths, and more detailed lunar data to expand the scope of the visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project successfully utilized data visualization to interpret and present complex astronomical data in an accessible format, enhancing educational tools for astronomy and fostering a better understanding of our solar system.
